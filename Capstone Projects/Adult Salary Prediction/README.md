# ADULT SALARY PREDICTION


### Description
- Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))


### Problem
- The project is aimed at building machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting whether the annual income of an individual exceeds $50K/yr based on the dataset (also known as "Census Income" dataset).

### Tasks
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Preprocess the data to make it ready for model building (encode categorical features, standardize or normalize numerical features, handle missing values, etc).
1. Identify the type of machine learning this project falls under briefly explain it in your own words (In your report).
2. Build and train model(s) to predict whether or not the annual salary is above $50K.
3. Use your model to make predictions on the test set.
4. Check the performance of the model using various metrics familiar to you.
5. (Optional) Perform hyperparameter tuning if necessary.
6. (Optional) If multiple algorithms are used, a comparative analysis of their relative performances and the overall best model should be given (in the report).
7. Write a brief report (no more than 6 pages) of your project. The report should at least include
    - a brief description of the dataset used
    - a brief overview of your understanding of machine learning (ML), the task/type of ML involved in this project and a brief overview algorithm(s) used
    - a brief overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model and what they mean.
    - results and interpretation.
    - cite all relevant resources used and also the source of the data.

***NB:*** The test set to be used can be found in the adult.test file. In this project, you're to split the test set (in an appreciable proportion) into the validation and actual test set. 

### Submission Files
- You are to submit both the notebook file containing your codes (as a pdf) and the report of your project (The report should be at most 6 pages including the references).
