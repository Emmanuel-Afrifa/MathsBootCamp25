# WINE QUALITY PREDICTION

### Description
- Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).


### Problem
- The project is aimed at building machine learning (ML) models capable of predicting predicting the wine quality scores (0 - 10).

### Tasks
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocess the data to make it ready for model building (encode categorical features, standardize or normalize numerical features, handle missing values, etc).
- Identify the type of machine learning this project falls under briefly explain it in your own words (In your report).
- Build and train model(s) to predict the wine quality scores based on physicochemical attributes.
- Use your model to make predictions on the test set.
- Check the performance of the model using various metrics familiar to you.
- (Optional) Perform hyperparameter tuning if necessary.
- (Optional) If multiple algorithms are used, a comparative analysis of their relative performances and the overall best model should be given (in the report).
- Write a brief report (no more than 6 pages) of your project. The report should at least include
    - a brief description of the dataset used
    - a brief overview of your understanding of machine learning (ML), the task/type of ML involved in this project and a brief overview algorithm(s) used
    - a brief overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model and what they mean.
    - results and interpretation.
    - cite all relevant resources used and also the source of the data.
- (Optional) The once you're done with the regression bit, you could try using the dataset for a classification task (categorizing wine quality into low, medium, high, etc).


### Submission Files
- You are to submit both the notebook file containing your codes (as a pdf) and the report of your project (The report should be at most 6 pages including the references).
