# Introduction

Welcome to The Mathematics for Machine Learning BootCamp, a comprehensive program designed to provide a solid foundation in Mathematics for Machine Learning.  Our focus is on current university students, undergraduates or graduates aspiring to deepen their grasp of mathematics in the context of machine learning, this program promises an enriching learning experience.

The BootCamp is structured to include two-hour session for 4 consecutive Sundays (i.e 2 hours every Sunday) focused on essential Machine Learning topics crucial for foundational understanding. To enhance learning, the program integrates practical applications, providing students with an opportunity to explore real-world implementations of the curriculum. Furthermore, the course includes assignments to evaluate students' comprehension and incorporates a capstone project, which serves as a valuable addition to their career portfolios.
